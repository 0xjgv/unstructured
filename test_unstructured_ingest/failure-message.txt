There are differences from the previously checked-in structured outputs.

If these differences are acceptable, overwrite by the fixtures by setting the env var:

  export OVERWRITE_FIXTURES=true

and then rerun this script.

NOTE: You'll likely just want to run scripts/ingest-test-fixtures-update.sh on x86_64 hardware
to update fixtures for CI.
