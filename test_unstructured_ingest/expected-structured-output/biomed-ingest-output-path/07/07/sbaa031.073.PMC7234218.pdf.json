    "text": "Background:  Meta-analytic  evidence  showed  increased  levels  of  periph-\neral  endocannabinoid  metabolites  in  psychotic  illness.  Alterations  in  the \nendocannabinoid  system  are  believed  to  compromise  glutamate  and  do-\npamine  transmission,  which  play  a  central  role  in  pathophysiological \nmodels  of  psychosis.  I  will  present  preliminary  data  from  an  ongoing \nhigh-field proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study aimed at \ninvestigating the association between peripheral levels of endocannabinoid \nsystem metabolites and central glutamate metabolism in individuals at their \nfirst non-affective psychotic episode (NA-FEP) and healthy controls.\nMethods:  We  expect  to  recruit  17  NA-FEP  and  20  healthy  controls  by \nJanuary 2020. Currently, we recruited 12 NA-FEP and 18 healthy controls \nfrom  two  different  research  facilities  (Imperial  College  London  and \nUniversity of Oxford) as part of a cross-sectional study. Participants un-\nderwent  MRS  scanning  at  7-T  with  voxels  placed  in  right  dorsolateral \nprefrontal cortex (right-DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and oc-\ncipital cortex. Neuro-metabolites will be calculated using the unsuppressed \nwater  signal  as  reference.  Endocannabinoid  metabolites  were  quantified \nfrom serum samples, collected during the same imaging session.\nResults:  Analyses  are  ongoing.  Based  on  previous  evidence,  expected \nfindings are: (i) reduced glutamate levels in the ACC and right-DLPFC of \nNA-FEP compared to controls; (ii) increased peripheral endocannabinoid \nmetabolites in NA-FEP compared to controls; and (iii) inverse association \nbetween  peripheral  endocannabinoid  metabolites  and  glutamate  levels  in \nACC and right-DLPFC in NA-FEP\nDiscussion:  This  study  will  help  clarifying  the  contribution  of  peripheral \nendocannabinoid system to central brain mechanisms of key relevance for \npsychotic illness. It will also add further evidence on the limited literature \non high-resolution characterisation of brain metabolites in early psychosis. \nStrengths of the study include: (i) use of high-field MRS, which allows the \nestimation  of  glutamate-related  compounds  at  higher  precision  than  at \nlower field strength; (ii) reduced heterogeneity of the clinical sample (only \nmale  and  NA-FEP).  Limitations:  small  sample  size  and  cross-sectional \ndesign.\n"

    "text": "Background:  Slow  waves,  the  hallmark  of  the  deep  nonrapid  eye  move-\nment  sleep  electroencephalogram  (EEG),  are  critical  for  restorative  sleep \nand brain plasticity. They arise from the synchronous depolarization and \nhyperpolarization  of  millions  of  cortical  neurons  and  their  proper  gen-\neration  and  propagation  relies  upon  the  integrity  of  widespread  cortico-\nthalamic networks. Slow wave abnormalities have been reported in patient \nwith Schizophrenia, although with partially contradictory results, probably \nrelated to antipsychotic and sedative medications. Recently, their presence \nand  delineation,  have  been  convincingly  shown  in  first-episode  psychosis \npatients (FEP). However, clear evidence of this biomarker at the onset of \nthe  disease,  prior  to  any  psychopharmacological  intervention,  remains \nlimited. Moreover, no attempt has been made to elucidate the prognostic \nmeaning of this finding.\nMethods: We collected whole night sleep high–density electroencephalog-\nraphy recordings (64-channel BrainAmp, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, \nGermany) in 20 drug-naive FEP patients and 20 healthy control subjects \n(HC).  Several  clinical  psychometric  scales  as  well  as  neurocognitive  tests \nwere administered to all subjects in order to better define psychopatholog-\nical status and vulnerability. EEG slow wave activity (SWA, spectral power \nbetween 1 and 4 Hz) and several slow wave parameters were computed at \neach electrode location, including density and amplitude, at each electrode \nlocation. Along with a group analysis between FEP and HC, a subgroup \nanalysis  was  also  computed  between  patients  who  showed  a  progression \nof  symptoms  to  full-blown  Schizophrenia  (SCZ,  n  =  10)  over  the  next \n12-month follow-up and those who did not (OTH, n = 10).\nResults: Sleep macro-architecture was globally preserved in FEP patients. \nSWA (1–4 Hz) was lower in FEP compared to HC but this difference didn’t \nreach  statistical  significance.  Slow  wave  density  was  decreased  in  FEP \ncompared  to  HC,  with  a  significance  that  survived  multiple  comparison \ncorrection  over  a  large  fronto-central  cluster.  Mean  amplitude  was  pre-\nserved.  At  the  subgroup  analysis,  these  results  were  largely  driven  by  the \nsubgroup of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SCZ at a 12-month fol-\nlow-up. Indeed, no difference could be found between OTH and HC, while \na strong significance was still evident between SCZ and HC.\n"
