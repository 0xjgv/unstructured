Awareness of this risk has launched efforts to create and deploy cryptographic-systems that are robust to quantum cryptanalysis, for which there are several candidates currently believed to be quantum safe. However, while deploying post-quantum cryptography in govern- ment and civilian systems may protect subsequent communications, it will not remove the security risk to prequantum encrypted data that has already been intercepted by an adversary, although the magnitude of this risk decreases as the arrival time of a QC capable of deploying Shor’s algorithm increases and the data becomes less relevant.

      "Quantum mechanics, the subﬁeld of physics that describes the behav- ior of very small particles, provides the basis for a new paradigm of computing. Quantum computing (QC) was ﬁrst proposed in the 1980s as a way to improve computational modeling of the behavior of very small (“quantum”) physical systems. Interest in the ﬁeld grew in the 1990s with the introduction of Shor’s algorithm, which, if implemented on a quantum computer, would exponentially speed up an important class of cryptanalysis and potentially threaten some of the cryptographic methods used to protect government and civilian communications and stored data. In fact, quantum computers are the only known model for computing that could offer exponential speedup over today’s computers.1\n",

Historically, classical computing has had a transformative impact across society. While the potential for applying quantum algorithms to industrial and research applications has only begun to be explored, it is clear that quantum computing has the potential to transcend current computational boundaries. The potential to improve efﬁciency in many areas of compu- tation suggests that supporting a robust QC research community in the United States is of strategic value.\n"
